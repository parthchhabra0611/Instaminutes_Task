Yes Gauri tell me tell me something about you   My name is Gauri shirmali  I am from Udaipur Rajasthan  I'm doing computer science engineering from Geetanjali Institute of technical studies  I secured 9 2 c GPA in 10, standard 73 4 Cgp ahh percentage in 12 standard  And currently an engineering my aggregate score is 77 percentage  computer sciences is omnipresent that is it is present in every field and hence I have invested these last 3 5 almost years and a developing my software skills My technical skills include programming in Python, Java, C, c++, databases I am also familiar with web development, Kubernetes, Docker, Ansible, et cetera  I've also participated in smart India hackathons of which ahh in one we also got to the finals  And currently I am one of the cultural heads of our students club, So I've I have also participated in several donation camps several donation camps as I am a  a member of the Rotary Club Udaipur, I consider myself as a very focused person, I’ve  and I always work towards my goals and in a very efficient manner  I am a team player and very optimistic in tough times And lastly I would like to say that why not start the journey of my success by the success of joining TCS Thank you so much  Okay ahh What are the five specific point about Tcs which makes Tcs different from the other IT MNCs?   Sure firstly sir ahh tcs is has a brand name, it is known it is a multinational company and it has a very good brand name and thus it would give me a good start for my career  Secondly, it has a work life balance  I have talked to many of my friends who are in Tcs and they say that Tcs gives a very good work life balance  So that is the second point  Third point is the colleagues there hardraw very futuristic in their skills  Fourthly, as Tcs is a multinational company, I would like to I would have the chance to even uhh go abroad and a meet a people of different nationalities  And lastly there as Tcs is has been in the industry for almost hundred and fifty years  Okay what are the ethical values Tcs have?   Okay okay Gauri nice talking to you , thankyou sir , and  I request kernel rathor sir to take next part of interview Right  Good afternoon   Good afternoon sir   Okay so how have you prepared for TCS interview now?   Sir I have an enhanced my technical skills I have been preparing for the core subjects, and I've been doing coding almost every day So I think that I prepared quite well For Tcs  Sir my future plans sir if I join TCS or otherwise   That's for you, what are the three important things ah that ah one should consider before joining any organization as a fresher?   So firstly the one should look if there is a lot to learn from the company, I mean, there should be a very steep like growing curve in the company  Secondly, they should be like the colleagues and everything should be very frank so that they help you in every way and thirdly  for me there should be a brand name so that there is a satisfaction that yes I have achieved a level and now I can go to the next level  So how does TCS fit into your requirement?   Sir tcs changes with technologies according to the needs of the people of the or so there is not a there is no fixed technology that they use they use according to the clients which is very well  which are the major clients of TCS? Can you name three or four of them?   No sir entrepreneurship No  but the highest studies many of the companies Tcs also provide like conc simultaneously highest studies So that may also be a very good option  Okay for example you have got you have got the offer from Tcs Or at the same time Meanwhile you're getting the better offer than Tcs from another organization which is not a tier one organization but tier two organization but the packages just develop what we are offering then what you will do?   defiantly I’ve told the tcs is the tier one and you've got the offer from tier two it means the startup or midsize company with the package for example, we are giving you four lakh they are giving you eight lakh in that case what do you do?    Sir I choose Tcs only because Tcs is like almost hundred and fifty years old company so it it has a very good job security  if you will not perform well in the tcs also you can get the job insecurity in tcs also  Sir but I will perform good and I would like from my end there will be no complaints from Tcs  Good afternoon sir   Good afternoon ah which domain you feel comfortable?   Ah sir core subject subjects programming C++ , DBMS Yes sir  Hua Gauri   Yes sir thoda thoda ah sir we can   Verbaly btao to bus when I can analyze that you are going in the right direction or not  Okay sir ah so ah firstly a we will the will like a this for example of how how many columns are there for example, I take disk of fifty the maximum we take a fifty and then now we take dice  so a variable in which we will take a random function with the help of random function, we can derive a number between one to six and for the first for the first move, if the numbers random number is six, then we can move like we can keep a counter of the player  And then now we can predefine the snakes for example, if at if we reach five then the the counter should like increased by 10 blocks  so the counter will increase by ten block That is the ladder and this way we can like pre define the next  For example, if the dice value for if if the dice value or the that block value in which the counter is right now is five so I have assigned five already that five is a ladder, so then it will increase and for example if 12 is a snake then I've already defined that at 12 you need to decrement the value by for example FIFO or whatever  If we are using C then and C++, Java there we doesn't have any dictionary   switch yes hnn but so we can use but it is too long like we will have to write the code many times in switch   cause switch for snake and switch for a ladder two separate switches we can use yes sir that we can   ahh so what do you mean by the encapsulation is Divyansh answer is correct  Explore more and more Tcs technical interview questions right? Ok sir They are basically mainly from C and C++  A from my side and rathor sir interview my remark for you definitely you are the good candidate that we have already observed many time ahh technical knowledge I have not checked out your head of department CAC will check it out but a you can easily correct the process
